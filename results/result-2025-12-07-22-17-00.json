Create a component with a hardcoded array of 3 book titles (strings) - \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and \"1984\"\n2. Create a snippet called `title` that takes a book title string as a parameter\n3. The snippet should display the book title in a `<span>` element with `data-testid=\"book-title\"`\n4. Use the `{@render ...}` syntax to render the snippet for each book title in a list\n5. Each rendered title should be wrapped in a `<li>` element with `data-testid=\"book-item\"`\n\n## Example HTML structure:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">The Lord of the Rings</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">To Kill a Mockingbird</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">1984</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 runes.\n",

Create a snippet called `title` that takes a book title string as a parameter\n3. The snippet should display the book title in a `<span>` element with `data-testid=\"book-title\"`\n4. Use the `{@render ...}` syntax to render the snippet for each book title in a list\n5. Each rendered title should be wrapped in a `<li>` element with `data-testid=\"book-item\"`\n\n## Example HTML structure:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">The Lord of the Rings</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">To Kill a Mockingbird</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">1984</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 runes.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: When you have finished implementing the component, use the ResultWrite tool to output your final Svelte component code.

Create a component with a hardcoded array of 3 book titles (strings) - \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and \"1984\"\n2. Create a snippet called `title` that takes a book title string as a parameter\n3. The snippet should display the book title in a `<span>` element with `data-testid=\"book-title\"`\n4. Use the `{@render ...}` syntax to render the snippet for each book title in a list\n5. Each rendered title should be wrapped in a `<li>` element with `data-testid=\"book-item\"`\n\n## Example HTML structure:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">The Lord of the Rings</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">To Kill a Mockingbird</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">1984</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 runes.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: When you have finished implementing the component, use the ResultWrite tool to output your final Svelte component code. Only output the component code itself, no explanations or markdown formatting."

You cannot use rest parameters, however.\n\n## Snippet scope\n\nSnippets can be declared anywhere inside your component. They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the `<script>` tag or in `{#each ...}` blocks ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE12P0QrCMAxFfyWrwhSEvc8p-h1OcG5RC10bmkyQ0n-3HQPBx3vCPUmCemiDrOpLULYbUdXqTKR2Sj6UA7_RCKbMbvJ9Jg33XpMcW9uKQYEAIzJ3T4QD3LSUDE-PnYA4YET4uOkGMc3W5B3xZrtvbVP9HDas2GqiZHqhMW6Tr9jGbG_oOCMImcUCwrIpFk1FqRyqpRpn0cmjHdAvnrIzuscyq_4nd3dPPD01ukE_NA6qFj9hvMYvGjJADw8BAAA=))...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#snippet hello(name)}\n\t<p>hello {name}! {message}!</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render hello('alice')}\n{@render hello('bob')}\n```\n\n...and they are 'visible' to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings):\n\n```svelte\n<div>\n\t{#snippet x()}\n\t\t{#snippet y()}...{/snippet}\n\n\t\t<!-- this is fine -->\n\t\t{@render y()}\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t<!-- this will error, as `y` is not in scope -->\n\t{@render y()}\n</div>\n\n<!-- this will also error, as `x` is not in scope -->\n{@render x()}\n```\n\nSnippets can reference themselves and each other ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE2WPTQqDMBCFrxLiRqH1Zysi7TlqF1YnENBJSGJLCYGeo5tesUeosfYH3c2bee_jjaWMd6BpfrAU6x5oTvdS0g01V-mFPkNnYNRaDKrxGxto5FKCIaeu1kYwFkauwsoUWtZYPh_3W5FMY4U2mb3egL9kIwY0rbhgiO-sDTgjSEqSTvIDs-jiOP7i_MHuFGAL6p9BtiSbOTl0GtzCuihqE87cqtyam6WRGz_vRcsZh5bmRg3gju4Fptq_kzQBAAA=)):\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet blastoff()}\n\t<span>🚀</span>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet countdown(n)}\n\t{#if n > 0}\n\t\t<span>{n}...</span>\n\t\t{@render countdown(n - 1)}\n\t{:else}\n\t\t{@render blastoff()}\n\t{/if}\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render countdown(10)}\n```\n\n## Passing snippets to components\n\n### Explicit props\n\nWithin the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VS247aMBD9lZGpBGwDASRegonaPvQL2qdlH5zYEKvBNvbQLbL875VzAcKyj3PmzJnLGU8UOwqSkd8KJdaCk4TsZS0cyV49wYuJuQiQpGd-N2bu_ooaI1YwJ57hpVYoFDqSEepKKw3mO7VDeTTaIvxiRS1gb_URxvO0ibrS8WanIrHUyiHs7Vmigy28RmyHHmKvDMbMmFq4cQInvGSwTsBYWYoMVhCSB2rBFFPsyl0uruTlR3JZCWvlTXl1Yy_mawiR_rbZKZrellJ-5JQ0RiBUgnFhJ9OGR7HKmwVoilXeIye8DOJGfYCgRlZ3iE876TBsZPX7hPdteO75PC4QaIo8vwNPePmANQ2fMeEFHrLD7rR1jTNkW986E8C3KwfwVr8HSHOSEBT_kGRozyIkn_zQveXDL3rIfPJHtUDwzShJd_Qk3gQCbOGLsdq4yfTRJopRuin3I7nv6kL7ARRjmLdBDG3uv1mhuLA3V2mKtqNEf_oCn8p9aN-WYqH5peP4kWBl1UwJzAEPT9U7K--0fRrrWnPTXpCm1_EVdXjpNmlA8G1hPPyM1fKgMqjFHjctXGjLhZ05w0qpDhksGrybuNEHtJnCalZWsuaTlfq6nPaaBSv_HKw-K57BjzOiVj9ZKQYKzQjZodYFqydYTRN4gPhVzTDO2xnma3HsVWjaLjT8nbfwHy7Q5f2dBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\timport Table from './Table.svelte';\n\n\tconst fruits = [\n\t\t{ name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 },\n\t\t{ name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 },\n\t\t{ name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 }\n\t];\n</script>\n\n{#snippet header()}\n\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t<th>qty</th>\n\t<th>price</th>\n\t<th>total</th>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet row(d)}\n\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n{/snippet}\n\n<Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />\n```\n\nThink about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"

Instead of writing duplicative code like [this](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE5VUYW-kIBD9K8Tmsm2yXXRzvQ-s3eR-R-0HqqOQKhAZb9sz_vdDkV1t000vRmHewMx7w2AflbIGG7GnPlK8gYhFv42JthG-m9Gwf6BGcLbVXZuPSGrzVho8ZirDGpDIhldgySN5GpEMez9kaNuckY1ANJZRamRuu2ZnhEZt6a84pvs43mzD4pMsUDDi8DMkQFYCGdkvsJwblFq5uCik9bmJ4JZwUkv1eoknWigX2eGNN6aGXa6bjV8ybP-X7sM36T58SVcrIIV2xVIaA41xeD5kKqWXuqpUJEefOqVuOkL9DfBchGrzWfu0vb-RpTd3o-zBR045Ga3HfuE5BmJpKauuhbPtENlUF2sqR9jqpsPSxWsMrlngyj3VJiyYjJXb1-lMa7IWC-iSk2M5Zzh-SJjShe-siq5kpZRPs55BbSGU5YPyte4vVV_VfFXxVb10dSLf17pS2lM5HnpPxw4Zpv6x-F57p0jI3OKlVnhv5V9wPQrNYQQ9D_f6aGHlC89fq1Z3qmDkJCTCweOGF4VUFSPJvD_DhreVdA0eu8ehJJ5x91dBaBkpWm3ureCFPt3uzRv56d4kdp-2euG38XZ6dsnd3ZmPG9yRBCrzRUvi-MccOdwz3qE-fOZ7AwAhlrtTUx3c76vRhSwlFBHDtoPhefgHX3dM0PkEAAA=)...\n\n```svelte\n{#each images as image}\n\t{#if image.href}\n\t\t<a href={image.href}>\n\t\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t\t<img src={image.src} alt={image.caption} width={image.width} height={image.height} />\n\t\t\t\t<figcaption>{image.caption}</figcaption>\n\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t</a>\n\t{:else}\n\t\t<figure>\n\t\t\t<img src={image.src} alt={image.caption} width={image.width} height={image.height} />\n\t\t\t<figcaption>{image.caption}</figcaption>\n\t\t</figure>\n\t{/if}\n{/each}\n```\n\n...you can write [this](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE5VUYW-bMBD9KxbRlERKY4jWfSA02n5H6QcXDmwVbMs-lnaI_z6D7TTt1moTAnPvzvfenQ_GpBEd2CS_HxPJekjy5IfWyS7BFz0b9id0CM62ajDVjBS2MkLjqZQldoBE9KwFS-7I_YyUOPqlRGuqnKw5orY5pVpUduj3mitUln5LU3pI0_UuBp9FjTwnDr9AHETLMSeHK6xiGoWSLi9yYT034cwSRjohn17zcQPNFTs8s153sK9Uv_Yh0-5_5d7-o9zbD-UqCaRWrllSYZQxLw_HUhb0ta-y4NnJUxfUvc7QuLJSaO0a3oh2MLBZat8u-wsPnXzKQvTtVVF34xK5d69ThFmHEQ4SpzeVRediTG8rjD5vBSeN3E5JyHh6R1DQK9-iml5kjzQUN_lSgVU8DhYLx7wwjSvRkMDvTjiwF4zM1kXZ7DlF1eN3A7IG85e-zRrYEjjm0FkI4Cc7Ripm0pHOChexhcWXzreeZyRMU6Mk3ljxC9w4QH-cQZ_b3T5pjHxk1VNr1CDrnJy5QDh6XLO6FrLNSRb2l9gz0wo3S6m7HErSgLsPGMHkpDZK31jOanXeHPQz-eruLHUP0z6yTbpbrn223V70uMXNSpQSZjpL0y8hcxxpNqA6_ql3BQAxlxvfpQ_uT9GrWjQC6iRHM8D0MP0GQsIi92QEAAA=):\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet figure(image)}\n\t<figure>\n\t\t<img src={image.src} alt={image.caption} width={image.width} height={image.height} />\n\t\t<figcaption>{image.caption}</figcaption>\n\t</figure>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#each images as image}\n\t{#if image.href}\n\t\t<a href={image.href}>\n\t\t\t{@render figure(image)}\n\t\t</a>\n\t{:else}\n\t\t{@render figure(image)}\n\t{/if}\n{/each}\n```\n\nLike function declarations, snippets can have an arbitrary number of parameters, which can have default values, and you can destructure each parameter. You cannot use rest parameters, however.\n\n## Snippet scope\n\nSnippets can be declared anywhere inside your component. They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the `<script>` tag or in `{#each ...}` blocks ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE12P0QrCMAxFfyWrwhSEvc8p-h1OcG5RC10bmkyQ0n-3HQPBx3vCPUmCemiDrOpLULYbUdXqTKR2Sj6UA7_RCKbMbvJ9Jg33XpMcW9uKQYEAIzJ3T4QD3LSUDE-PnYA4YET4uOkGMc3W5B3xZrtvbVP9HDas2GqiZHqhMW6Tr9jGbG_oOCMImcUCwrIpFk1FqRyqpRpn0cmjHdAvnrIzuscyq_4nd3dPPD01ukE_NA6qFj9hvMYvGjJADw8BAAA=))...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#snippet hello(name)}\n\t<p>hello {name}! {message}!</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render hello('alice')}\n{@render hello('bob')}\n```\n\n...and they are 'visible' to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings):\n\n```svelte\n<div>\n\t{#snippet x()}\n\t\t{#snippet y()}...{/snippet}\n\n\t\t<!-- this is fine -->\n\t\t{@render y()}\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t<!-- this will error, as `y` is not in scope -->\n\t{@render y()}\n</div>\n\n<!-- this will also error, as `x` is not in scope -->\n{@render x()}\n```\n\nSnippets can reference themselves and each other ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE2WPTQqDMBCFrxLiRqH1Zysi7TlqF1YnENBJSGJLCYGeo5tesUeosfYH3c2bee_jjaWMd6BpfrAU6x5oTvdS0g01V-mFPkNnYNRaDKrxGxto5FKCIaeu1kYwFkauwsoUWtZYPh_3W5FMY4U2mb3egL9kIwY0rbhgiO-sDTgjSEqSTvIDs-jiOP7i_MHuFGAL6p9BtiSbOTl0GtzCuihqE87cqtyam6WRGz_vRcsZh5bmRg3gju4Fptq_kzQBAAA=)):\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet blastoff()}\n\t<span>🚀</span>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet countdown(n)}\n\t{#if n > 0}\n\t\t<span>{n}...</span>\n\t\t{@render countdown(n - 1)}\n\t{:else}\n\t\t{@render blastoff()}\n\t{/if}\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render countdown(10)}\n```\n\n## Passing snippets to components\n\n### Explicit props\n\nWithin the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VS247aMBD9lZGpBGwDASRegonaPvQL2qdlH5zYEKvBNvbQLbL875VzAcKyj3PmzJnLGU8UOwqSkd8KJdaCk4TsZS0cyV49wYuJuQiQpGd-N2bu_ooaI1YwJ57hpVYoFDqSEepKKw3mO7VDeTTaIvxiRS1gb_URxvO0ibrS8WanIrHUyiHs7Vmigy28RmyHHmKvDMbMmFq4cQInvGSwTsBYWYoMVhCSB2rBFFPsyl0uruTlR3JZCWvlTXl1Yy_mawiR_rbZKZrellJ-5JQ0RiBUgnFhJ9OGR7HKmwVoilXeIye8DOJGfYCgRlZ3iE876TBsZPX7hPdteO75PC4QaIo8vwNPePmANQ2fMeEFHrLD7rR1jTNkW986E8C3KwfwVr8HSHOSEBT_kGRozyIkn_zQveXDL3rIfPJHtUDwzShJd_Qk3gQCbOGLsdq4yfTRJopRuin3I7nv6kL7ARRjmLdBDG3uv1mhuLA3V2mKtqNEf_oCn8p9aN-WYqH5peP4kWBl1UwJzAEPT9U7K--0fRrrWnPTXpCm1_EVdXjpNmlA8G1hPPyM1fKgMqjFHjctXGjLhZ05w0qpDhksGrybuNEHtJnCalZWsuaTlfq6nPaaBSv_HKw-K57BjzOiVj9ZKQYKzQjZodYFqydYTRN4gPhVzTDO2xnma3HsVWjaLjT8nbfwHy7Q5f2dBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\timport Table from './Table.svelte';\n\n\tconst fruits = [\n\t\t{ name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 },\n\t\t{ name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 },\n\t\t{ name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 }\n\t];\n</script>\n\n{#snippet header()}\n\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t<th>qty</th>\n\t<th>price</th>\n\t<th>total</th>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet row(d)}\n\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n{/snippet}\n\n<Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />\n```\n\nThink about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"

Create a component with a hardcoded array of 3 book titles (strings) - \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and \"1984\"\n2. Create a snippet called `title` that takes a book title string as a parameter\n3. The snippet should display the book title in a `<span>` element with `data-testid=\"book-title\"`\n4. Use the `{@render ...}` syntax to render the snippet for each book title in a list\n5. Each rendered title should be wrapped in a `<li>` element with `data-testid=\"book-item\"`\n\n## Example HTML structure:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">The Lord of the Rings</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">To Kill a Mockingbird</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">1984</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 runes.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: When you have finished implementing the component, use the ResultWrite tool to output your final Svelte component code. Only output the component code itself, no explanations or markdown formatting."

You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script>\\n    let { children } = $props();\\n</script>\\n\\n{@render children?.()}\\n```\\n\\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script>\\n    let { children } = $props();\\n</script>\\n\\n{#if children}\\n    {@render children()}\\n{:else}\\n    fallback content\\n{/if}\\n```\\n\\n## Typing snippets\\n\\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script lang=\\\"ts\\\">\\n\\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\\n\\n\\tinterface Props {\\n\\t\\tdata: any[];\\n\\t\\tchildren: Snippet;\\n\\t\\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\\n\\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script lang=\\\"ts\\\" generics=\\\"T\\\">\\n\\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\\n\\n\\tlet {\\n\\t\\tdata,\\n\\t\\tchildren,\\n\\t\\trow\\n\\t}: {\\n\\t\\tdata: T[];\\n\\t\\tchildren: Snippet;\\n\\t\\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\\n\\t} = $props();\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\n## Exporting snippets\\n\\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script module>\\n\\texport { add };\\n</script>\\n\\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\\n\\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\\n{/snippet}\\n```\\n\\n> [!NOTE]\\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\\n\\n## Programmatic snippets\\n\\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\\n\\n## Snippets and slots\\n\\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## {@render ...}\\n\\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\\n\\n```svelte\\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\\n\\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\\n{/snippet}\\n\\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\\n```\\n\\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\\n\\n```svelte\\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\\n```\\n\\n## Optional snippets\\n\\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\\n\\n```svelte\\n{@render children?.()}\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\\n\\n```svelte\\n{#if children}\\n\\t{@render children()}\\n{:else}\\n\\t<p>fallback content</p>\\n{/if}\\n```\"}],\"isError\":false}"

They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the `<script>` tag or in `{#each ...}` blocks ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE12P0QrCMAxFfyWrwhSEvc8p-h1OcG5RC10bmkyQ0n-3HQPBx3vCPUmCemiDrOpLULYbUdXqTKR2Sj6UA7_RCKbMbvJ9Jg33XpMcW9uKQYEAIzJ3T4QD3LSUDE-PnYA4YET4uOkGMc3W5B3xZrtvbVP9HDas2GqiZHqhMW6Tr9jGbG_oOCMImcUCwrIpFk1FqRyqpRpn0cmjHdAvnrIzuscyq_4nd3dPPD01ukE_NA6qFj9hvMYvGjJADw8BAAA=))...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#snippet hello(name)}\n\t<p>hello {name}! {message}!</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render hello('alice')}\n{@render hello('bob')}\n```\n\n...and they are 'visible' to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings):\n\n```svelte\n<div>\n\t{#snippet x()}\n\t\t{#snippet y()}...{/snippet}\n\n\t\t<!-- this is fine -->\n\t\t{@render y()}\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t<!-- this will error, as `y` is not in scope -->\n\t{@render y()}\n</div>\n\n<!-- this will also error, as `x` is not in scope -->\n{@render x()}\n```\n\nSnippets can reference themselves and each other ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE2WPTQqDMBCFrxLiRqH1Zysi7TlqF1YnENBJSGJLCYGeo5tesUeosfYH3c2bee_jjaWMd6BpfrAU6x5oTvdS0g01V-mFPkNnYNRaDKrxGxto5FKCIaeu1kYwFkauwsoUWtZYPh_3W5FMY4U2mb3egL9kIwY0rbhgiO-sDTgjSEqSTvIDs-jiOP7i_MHuFGAL6p9BtiSbOTl0GtzCuihqE87cqtyam6WRGz_vRcsZh5bmRg3gju4Fptq_kzQBAAA=)):\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet blastoff()}\n\t<span>🚀</span>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet countdown(n)}\n\t{#if n > 0}\n\t\t<span>{n}...</span>\n\t\t{@render countdown(n - 1)}\n\t{:else}\n\t\t{@render blastoff()}\n\t{/if}\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render countdown(10)}\n```\n\n## Passing snippets to components\n\n### Explicit props\n\nWithin the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VS247aMBD9lZGpBGwDASRegonaPvQL2qdlH5zYEKvBNvbQLbL875VzAcKyj3PmzJnLGU8UOwqSkd8KJdaCk4TsZS0cyV49wYuJuQiQpGd-N2bu_ooaI1YwJ57hpVYoFDqSEepKKw3mO7VDeTTaIvxiRS1gb_URxvO0ibrS8WanIrHUyiHs7Vmigy28RmyHHmKvDMbMmFq4cQInvGSwTsBYWYoMVhCSB2rBFFPsyl0uruTlR3JZCWvlTXl1Yy_mawiR_rbZKZrellJ-5JQ0RiBUgnFhJ9OGR7HKmwVoilXeIye8DOJGfYCgRlZ3iE876TBsZPX7hPdteO75PC4QaIo8vwNPePmANQ2fMeEFHrLD7rR1jTNkW986E8C3KwfwVr8HSHOSEBT_kGRozyIkn_zQveXDL3rIfPJHtUDwzShJd_Qk3gQCbOGLsdq4yfTRJopRuin3I7nv6kL7ARRjmLdBDG3uv1mhuLA3V2mKtqNEf_oCn8p9aN-WYqH5peP4kWBl1UwJzAEPT9U7K--0fRrrWnPTXpCm1_EVdXjpNmlA8G1hPPyM1fKgMqjFHjctXGjLhZ05w0qpDhksGrybuNEHtJnCalZWsuaTlfq6nPaaBSv_HKw-K57BjzOiVj9ZKQYKzQjZodYFqydYTRN4gPhVzTDO2xnma3HsVWjaLjT8nbfwHy7Q5f2dBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\timport Table from './Table.svelte';\n\n\tconst fruits = [\n\t\t{ name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 },\n\t\t{ name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 },\n\t\t{ name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 }\n\t];\n</script>\n\n{#snippet header()}\n\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t<th>qty</th>\n\t<th>price</th>\n\t<th>total</th>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet row(d)}\n\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n{/snippet}\n\n<Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />\n```\n\nThink about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"

Create a component with a hardcoded array of 3 book titles (strings) - \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and \"1984\"\n2. Create a snippet called `title` that takes a book title string as a parameter\n3. The snippet should display the book title in a `<span>` element with `data-testid=\"book-title\"`\n4. Use the `{@render ...}` syntax to render the snippet for each book title in a list\n5. Each rendered title should be wrapped in a `<li>` element with `data-testid=\"book-item\"`\n\n## Example HTML structure:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">The Lord of the Rings</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">To Kill a Mockingbird</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">1984</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 runes.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: When you have finished implementing the component, use the ResultWrite tool to output your final Svelte component code. Only output the component code itself, no explanations or markdown formatting."

You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script>\\n    let { children } = $props();\\n</script>\\n\\n{@render children?.()}\\n```\\n\\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script>\\n    let { children } = $props();\\n</script>\\n\\n{#if children}\\n    {@render children()}\\n{:else}\\n    fallback content\\n{/if}\\n```\\n\\n## Typing snippets\\n\\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script lang=\\\"ts\\\">\\n\\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\\n\\n\\tinterface Props {\\n\\t\\tdata: any[];\\n\\t\\tchildren: Snippet;\\n\\t\\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\\n\\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script lang=\\\"ts\\\" generics=\\\"T\\\">\\n\\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\\n\\n\\tlet {\\n\\t\\tdata,\\n\\t\\tchildren,\\n\\t\\trow\\n\\t}: {\\n\\t\\tdata: T[];\\n\\t\\tchildren: Snippet;\\n\\t\\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\\n\\t} = $props();\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\n## Exporting snippets\\n\\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script module>\\n\\texport { add };\\n</script>\\n\\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\\n\\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\\n{/snippet}\\n```\\n\\n> [!NOTE]\\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\\n\\n## Programmatic snippets\\n\\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\\n\\n## Snippets and slots\\n\\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## {@render ...}\\n\\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\\n\\n```svelte\\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\\n\\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\\n{/snippet}\\n\\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\\n```\\n\\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\\n\\n```svelte\\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\\n```\\n\\n## Optional snippets\\n\\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\\n\\n```svelte\\n{@render children?.()}\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\\n\\n```svelte\\n{#if children}\\n\\t{@render children()}\\n{:else}\\n\\t<p>fallback content</p>\\n{/if}\\n```\"}],\"isError\":false}"

They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the `<script>` tag or in `{#each ...}` blocks ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE12P0QrCMAxFfyWrwhSEvc8p-h1OcG5RC10bmkyQ0n-3HQPBx3vCPUmCemiDrOpLULYbUdXqTKR2Sj6UA7_RCKbMbvJ9Jg33XpMcW9uKQYEAIzJ3T4QD3LSUDE-PnYA4YET4uOkGMc3W5B3xZrtvbVP9HDas2GqiZHqhMW6Tr9jGbG_oOCMImcUCwrIpFk1FqRyqpRpn0cmjHdAvnrIzuscyq_4nd3dPPD01ukE_NA6qFj9hvMYvGjJADw8BAAA=))...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#snippet hello(name)}\n\t<p>hello {name}! {message}!</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render hello('alice')}\n{@render hello('bob')}\n```\n\n...and they are 'visible' to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings):\n\n```svelte\n<div>\n\t{#snippet x()}\n\t\t{#snippet y()}...{/snippet}\n\n\t\t<!-- this is fine -->\n\t\t{@render y()}\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t<!-- this will error, as `y` is not in scope -->\n\t{@render y()}\n</div>\n\n<!-- this will also error, as `x` is not in scope -->\n{@render x()}\n```\n\nSnippets can reference themselves and each other ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE2WPTQqDMBCFrxLiRqH1Zysi7TlqF1YnENBJSGJLCYGeo5tesUeosfYH3c2bee_jjaWMd6BpfrAU6x5oTvdS0g01V-mFPkNnYNRaDKrxGxto5FKCIaeu1kYwFkauwsoUWtZYPh_3W5FMY4U2mb3egL9kIwY0rbhgiO-sDTgjSEqSTvIDs-jiOP7i_MHuFGAL6p9BtiSbOTl0GtzCuihqE87cqtyam6WRGz_vRcsZh5bmRg3gju4Fptq_kzQBAAA=)):\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet blastoff()}\n\t<span>🚀</span>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet countdown(n)}\n\t{#if n > 0}\n\t\t<span>{n}...</span>\n\t\t{@render countdown(n - 1)}\n\t{:else}\n\t\t{@render blastoff()}\n\t{/if}\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render countdown(10)}\n```\n\n## Passing snippets to components\n\n### Explicit props\n\nWithin the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VS247aMBD9lZGpBGwDASRegonaPvQL2qdlH5zYEKvBNvbQLbL875VzAcKyj3PmzJnLGU8UOwqSkd8KJdaCk4TsZS0cyV49wYuJuQiQpGd-N2bu_ooaI1YwJ57hpVYoFDqSEepKKw3mO7VDeTTaIvxiRS1gb_URxvO0ibrS8WanIrHUyiHs7Vmigy28RmyHHmKvDMbMmFq4cQInvGSwTsBYWYoMVhCSB2rBFFPsyl0uruTlR3JZCWvlTXl1Yy_mawiR_rbZKZrellJ-5JQ0RiBUgnFhJ9OGR7HKmwVoilXeIye8DOJGfYCgRlZ3iE876TBsZPX7hPdteO75PC4QaIo8vwNPePmANQ2fMeEFHrLD7rR1jTNkW986E8C3KwfwVr8HSHOSEBT_kGRozyIkn_zQveXDL3rIfPJHtUDwzShJd_Qk3gQCbOGLsdq4yfTRJopRuin3I7nv6kL7ARRjmLdBDG3uv1mhuLA3V2mKtqNEf_oCn8p9aN-WYqH5peP4kWBl1UwJzAEPT9U7K--0fRrrWnPTXpCm1_EVdXjpNmlA8G1hPPyM1fKgMqjFHjctXGjLhZ05w0qpDhksGrybuNEHtJnCalZWsuaTlfq6nPaaBSv_HKw-K57BjzOiVj9ZKQYKzQjZodYFqydYTRN4gPhVzTDO2xnma3HsVWjaLjT8nbfwHy7Q5f2dBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\timport Table from './Table.svelte';\n\n\tconst fruits = [\n\t\t{ name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 },\n\t\t{ name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 },\n\t\t{ name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 }\n\t];\n</script>\n\n{#snippet header()}\n\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t<th>qty</th>\n\t<th>price</th>\n\t<th>total</th>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet row(d)}\n\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n{/snippet}\n\n<Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />\n```\n\nThink about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"

Create a component with a hardcoded array of 3 book titles (strings) - \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", and \"1984\"\n2. Create a snippet called `title` that takes a book title string as a parameter\n3. The snippet should display the book title in a `<span>` element with `data-testid=\"book-title\"`\n4. Use the `{@render ...}` syntax to render the snippet for each book title in a list\n5. Each rendered title should be wrapped in a `<li>` element with `data-testid=\"book-item\"`\n\n## Example HTML structure:\n\n```html\n<ul>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">The Lord of the Rings</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">To Kill a Mockingbird</li>\n  <li data-testid=\"book-item\">1984</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nPlease implement this component using Svelte 5 runes.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: When you have finished implementing the component, use the ResultWrite tool to output your final Svelte component code. Only output the component code itself, no explanations or markdown formatting."

You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script>\\n    let { children } = $props();\\n</script>\\n\\n{@render children?.()}\\n```\\n\\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script>\\n    let { children } = $props();\\n</script>\\n\\n{#if children}\\n    {@render children()}\\n{:else}\\n    fallback content\\n{/if}\\n```\\n\\n## Typing snippets\\n\\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script lang=\\\"ts\\\">\\n\\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\\n\\n\\tinterface Props {\\n\\t\\tdata: any[];\\n\\t\\tchildren: Snippet;\\n\\t\\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\\n\\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script lang=\\\"ts\\\" generics=\\\"T\\\">\\n\\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\\n\\n\\tlet {\\n\\t\\tdata,\\n\\t\\tchildren,\\n\\t\\trow\\n\\t}: {\\n\\t\\tdata: T[];\\n\\t\\tchildren: Snippet;\\n\\t\\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\\n\\t} = $props();\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\n## Exporting snippets\\n\\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script module>\\n\\texport { add };\\n</script>\\n\\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\\n\\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\\n{/snippet}\\n```\\n\\n> [!NOTE]\\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\\n\\n## Programmatic snippets\\n\\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\\n\\n## Snippets and slots\\n\\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## {@render ...}\\n\\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\\n\\n```svelte\\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\\n\\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\\n{/snippet}\\n\\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\\n```\\n\\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\\n\\n```svelte\\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\\n```\\n\\n## Optional snippets\\n\\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\\n\\n```svelte\\n{@render children?.()}\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\\n\\n```svelte\\n{#if children}\\n\\t{@render children()}\\n{:else}\\n\\t<p>fallback content</p>\\n{/if}\\n```\"}],\"isError\":false}"

You cannot use rest parameters, however.\n\n## Snippet scope\n\nSnippets can be declared anywhere inside your component. They can reference values declared outside themselves, for example in the `<script>` tag or in `{#each ...}` blocks ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE12P0QrCMAxFfyWrwhSEvc8p-h1OcG5RC10bmkyQ0n-3HQPBx3vCPUmCemiDrOpLULYbUdXqTKR2Sj6UA7_RCKbMbvJ9Jg33XpMcW9uKQYEAIzJ3T4QD3LSUDE-PnYA4YET4uOkGMc3W5B3xZrtvbVP9HDas2GqiZHqhMW6Tr9jGbG_oOCMImcUCwrIpFk1FqRyqpRpn0cmjHdAvnrIzuscyq_4nd3dPPD01ukE_NA6qFj9hvMYvGjJADw8BAAA=))...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet { message = `it's great to see you!` } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#snippet hello(name)}\n\t<p>hello {name}! {message}!</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render hello('alice')}\n{@render hello('bob')}\n```\n\n...and they are 'visible' to everything in the same lexical scope (i.e. siblings, and children of those siblings):\n\n```svelte\n<div>\n\t{#snippet x()}\n\t\t{#snippet y()}...{/snippet}\n\n\t\t<!-- this is fine -->\n\t\t{@render y()}\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t<!-- this will error, as `y` is not in scope -->\n\t{@render y()}\n</div>\n\n<!-- this will also error, as `x` is not in scope -->\n{@render x()}\n```\n\nSnippets can reference themselves and each other ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE2WPTQqDMBCFrxLiRqH1Zysi7TlqF1YnENBJSGJLCYGeo5tesUeosfYH3c2bee_jjaWMd6BpfrAU6x5oTvdS0g01V-mFPkNnYNRaDKrxGxto5FKCIaeu1kYwFkauwsoUWtZYPh_3W5FMY4U2mb3egL9kIwY0rbhgiO-sDTgjSEqSTvIDs-jiOP7i_MHuFGAL6p9BtiSbOTl0GtzCuihqE87cqtyam6WRGz_vRcsZh5bmRg3gju4Fptq_kzQBAAA=)):\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet blastoff()}\n\t<span>🚀</span>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet countdown(n)}\n\t{#if n > 0}\n\t\t<span>{n}...</span>\n\t\t{@render countdown(n - 1)}\n\t{:else}\n\t\t{@render blastoff()}\n\t{/if}\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render countdown(10)}\n```\n\n## Passing snippets to components\n\n### Explicit props\n\nWithin the template, snippets are values just like any other. As such, they can be passed to components as props ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VS247aMBD9lZGpBGwDASRegonaPvQL2qdlH5zYEKvBNvbQLbL875VzAcKyj3PmzJnLGU8UOwqSkd8KJdaCk4TsZS0cyV49wYuJuQiQpGd-N2bu_ooaI1YwJ57hpVYoFDqSEepKKw3mO7VDeTTaIvxiRS1gb_URxvO0ibrS8WanIrHUyiHs7Vmigy28RmyHHmKvDMbMmFq4cQInvGSwTsBYWYoMVhCSB2rBFFPsyl0uruTlR3JZCWvlTXl1Yy_mawiR_rbZKZrellJ-5JQ0RiBUgnFhJ9OGR7HKmwVoilXeIye8DOJGfYCgRlZ3iE876TBsZPX7hPdteO75PC4QaIo8vwNPePmANQ2fMeEFHrLD7rR1jTNkW986E8C3KwfwVr8HSHOSEBT_kGRozyIkn_zQveXDL3rIfPJHtUDwzShJd_Qk3gQCbOGLsdq4yfTRJopRuin3I7nv6kL7ARRjmLdBDG3uv1mhuLA3V2mKtqNEf_oCn8p9aN-WYqH5peP4kWBl1UwJzAEPT9U7K--0fRrrWnPTXpCm1_EVdXjpNmlA8G1hPPyM1fKgMqjFHjctXGjLhZ05w0qpDhksGrybuNEHtJnCalZWsuaTlfq6nPaaBSv_HKw-K57BjzOiVj9ZKQYKzQjZodYFqydYTRN4gPhVzTDO2xnma3HsVWjaLjT8nbfwHy7Q5f2dBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\timport Table from './Table.svelte';\n\n\tconst fruits = [\n\t\t{ name: 'apples', qty: 5, price: 2 },\n\t\t{ name: 'bananas', qty: 10, price: 1 },\n\t\t{ name: 'cherries', qty: 20, price: 0.5 }\n\t];\n</script>\n\n{#snippet header()}\n\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t<th>qty</th>\n\t<th>price</th>\n\t<th>total</th>\n{/snippet}\n\n{#snippet row(d)}\n\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n{/snippet}\n\n<Table data={fruits} {header} {row} />\n```\n\nThink about it like passing content instead of data to a component. The concept is similar to slots in web components.\n\n### Implicit props\n\nAs an authoring convenience, snippets declared directly _inside_ a component implicitly become props _on_ the component ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3VSTa_aMBD8Kyu_SkAbCA-JSzBR20N_QXt6vIMTO8SqsY29tI2s_PcqTiB8vaPHs7MzuxuIZgdBMvJLo0QlOElIJZXwJHsLBBvb_XUASc7Mb9Yu_B-hsMMK5sUzvDQahUZPMkJ96aTFfKd3KA_WOISfrFACKmcOMFmk8TWUTjY73RFLoz1C5U4SPWzhrcN2GKDrlcGEWauEnyRwxCaDdQLWyVJksII2uaMWTDPNLtzX5YX8-kgua-GcHJVXI3u5WEPb0d83O03TMZSmfRzOkG1Db7mNacOL19JagVALxoWbztq-H8U6j0SaYp2P2BGbOyQ2v8PQIFMXLKRDk177pq0zf6d8bMrzwBdd0pamyPMb-IjNEzS2f86Gz_Dwf-2F9nvNSUJQ_EOSoTuJNvngqK5v4Pas7n4-OCwlEEJcQTIMO-nSQwtb-GSdsX46e9gbRoP9yGQ11I0rEuycunu6PHx1QnPhxm3SFN15MOlYEFJZtf0dUywMbwZOeBGsrKNLYB54-1R9WNqVdki7usim6VmQphf7mnpshiQRhNAXdoOfMyX3OgMlKtz0cGEcF27uLSul3mewjPjgOOoDukxjPS9rqfh0pb-8zs6aBSt_7505aZ7B9xOi0T9YKW4UooVsr0zB1BTrWQJ3EL-oWcZ572GxFoezCk37QLe3897-B2i2U62uBAAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!-- this is semantically the same as the above -->\n<Table data={fruits}>\n\t{#snippet header()}\n\t\t<th>fruit</th>\n\t\t<th>qty</th>\n\t\t<th>price</th>\n\t\t<th>total</th>\n\t{/snippet}\n\n\t{#snippet row(d)}\n\t\t<td>{d.name}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.price}</td>\n\t\t<td>{d.qty * d.price}</td>\n\t{/snippet}\n</Table>\n```\n\n### Implicit `children` snippet\n\nAny content inside the component tags that is _not_ a snippet declaration implicitly becomes part of the `children` snippet ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WOQQrCMBBFrzIMggql3ddY1Du4si5sOmIwnYRkFKX07lKqglqX8_7_w2uRDw1hjlsWI5ZqTPBoLEXMdy3K3fdZDzB5Ndfep_FKVnpWHSKNce1YiCVijirqYLwUJQOYxrsgsLmIOIZjcA1M02w4n-PpomSVvTclqyEutDX6DA2pZ7_ABIVugrmEC3XJH92P55_G39GodCmWBFrQJ2PrQAwdLGHig_NxNv9xrQa1dhWIawrv1Wzeqawa8953D-8QOmaEAQAA)):\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: App.svelte --->\n<Button>click me</Button>\n```\n\n```svelte\n<!--- file: Button.svelte --->\n<script>\n\tlet { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<!-- result will be <button>click me</button> -->\n<button>{@render children()}</button>\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] Note that you cannot have a prop called `children` if you also have content inside the component — for this reason, you should avoid having props with that name\n\n### Optional snippet props\n\nYou can declare snippet props as being optional. You can either use optional chaining to not render anything if the snippet isn't set...\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\n...or use an `#if` block to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n    let { children } = $props();\n</script>\n\n{#if children}\n    {@render children()}\n{:else}\n    fallback content\n{/if}\n```\n\n## Typing snippets\n\nSnippets implement the `Snippet` interface imported from `'svelte'`:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tinterface Props {\n\t\tdata: any[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[any]>;\n\t}\n\n\tlet { data, children, row }: Props = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\nWith this change, red squigglies will appear if you try and use the component without providing a `data` prop and a `row` snippet. Notice that the type argument provided to `Snippet` is a tuple, since snippets can have multiple parameters.\n\nWe can tighten things up further by declaring a generic, so that `data` and `row` refer to the same type:\n\n```svelte\n<script lang=\"ts\" generics=\"T\">\n\timport type { Snippet } from 'svelte';\n\n\tlet {\n\t\tdata,\n\t\tchildren,\n\t\trow\n\t}: {\n\t\tdata: T[];\n\t\tchildren: Snippet;\n\t\trow: Snippet<[T]>;\n\t} = $props();\n</script>\n```\n\n## Exporting snippets\n\nSnippets declared at the top level of a `.svelte` file can be exported from a `<script module>` for use in other components, provided they don't reference any declarations in a non-module `<script>` (whether directly or indirectly, via other snippets) ([demo](/playground/untitled#H4sIAAAAAAAAE3WPwY7CMAxEf8UyB1hRgdhjl13Bga8gHFJipEqtGyUGFUX5dxJUtEB3b9bYM_MckHVLWOKut50TMuC5tpbEY4GnuiGP5T6gXG0-ykLSB8vW2oW_UCNZq7Snv_Rjx0Kc4kpc-6OrrfwoVlK3uQ4CaGMgwsl1LUwXy0f54J9-KV4vf20cNo7YkMu22aqAz4-oOLUI9YKluDPF4h_at-hX5PFyzA1tZ84N3fGpf8YfUU6GvDumLqDKmEqCjjCHUEX4hqDTWCU5PJ6Or38c4g1cPu9tnAEAAA==)):\n\n```svelte\n<script module>\n\texport { add };\n</script>\n\n{#snippet add(a, b)}\n\t{a} + {b} = {a + b}\n{/snippet}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This requires Svelte 5.5.0 or newer\n\n## Programmatic snippets\n\nSnippets can be created programmatically with the [`createRawSnippet`](svelte#createRawSnippet) API. This is intended for advanced use cases.\n\n## Snippets and slots\n\nIn Svelte 4, content can be passed to components using [slots](legacy-slots). Snippets are more powerful and flexible, and so slots have been deprecated in Svelte 5.\n\n---\n\n## {@render ...}\n\nTo render a [snippet](snippet), use a `{@render ...}` tag.\n\n```svelte\n{#snippet sum(a, b)}\n\t<p>{a} + {b} = {a + b}</p>\n{/snippet}\n\n{@render sum(1, 2)}\n{@render sum(3, 4)}\n{@render sum(5, 6)}\n```\n\nThe expression can be an identifier like `sum`, or an arbitrary JavaScript expression:\n\n```svelte\n{@render (cool ? coolSnippet : lameSnippet)()}\n```\n\n## Optional snippets\n\nIf the snippet is potentially undefined — for example, because it's an incoming prop — then you can use optional chaining to only render it when it _is_ defined:\n\n```svelte\n{@render children?.()}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use an [`{#if ...}`](if) block with an `:else` clause to render fallback content:\n\n```svelte\n{#if children}\n\t{@render children()}\n{:else}\n\t<p>fallback content</p>\n{/if}\n```"
