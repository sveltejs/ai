                "text": "## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## basic-markup\n\nError: Section not found."

                        "text": "## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## basic-markup\n\nError: Section not found."

[Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\\n\\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\\n\\n```js\\nlet todos = $state([\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tdone: false,\\n\\t\\ttext: 'add more todos'\\n\\t}\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\\n\\n```js\\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\\n// ---cut---\\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\\n```\\n\\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\\n\\n```js\\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\\n// ---cut---\\ntodos.push({\\n\\tdone: false,\\n\\ttext: 'eat lunch'\\n});\\n```\\n\\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\\n\\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\\n\\n```js\\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\\n// ---cut---\\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\\n\\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\\n```\\n\\n### Classes\\n\\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\\n\\n```js\\n// @errors: 7006 2554\\nclass Todo {\\n\\tdone = $state(false);\\n\\n\\tconstructor(text) {\\n\\t\\tthis.text = $state(text);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\treset() {\\n\\t\\tthis.text = '';\\n\\t\\tthis.done = false;\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\\n\\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\\n\\treset\\n</button>\\n```\\n\\nYou can either use an inline function...\\n\\n```svelte\\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\\n\\treset\\n</button>\\n```\\n\\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\\n\\n```js\\n// @errors: 7006 2554\\nclass Todo {\\n\\tdone = $state(false);\\n\\n\\tconstructor(text) {\\n\\t\\tthis.text = $state(text);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\t+++reset = () => {+++\\n\\t\\tthis.text = '';\\n\\t\\tthis.done = false;\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Built-in classes\\n\\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\\n\\n## `$state.raw`\\n\\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\\n\\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\\n\\n```js\\nlet person = $state.raw({\\n\\tname: 'Heraclitus',\\n\\tage: 49\\n});\\n\\n// this will have no effect\\nperson.age += 1;\\n\\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\\nperson = {\\n\\tname: 'Heraclitus',\\n\\tage: 50\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\\n\\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\\n\\n## `$state.snapshot`\\n\\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script>\\n\\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\\n\\n\\tfunction onclick() {\\n\\t\\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\\n\\t\\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\\n\\t}\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\\n\\n## `$state.eager`\\n\\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\\n\\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<nav>\\n\\t<a href=\\\"/\\\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\\n\\t<a href=\\\"/about\\\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\\n</nav>\\n```\\n\\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\\n\\n## Passing state into functions\\n\\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\\n\\n```js\\n/// file: index.js\\n// @filename: index.js\\n// ---cut---\\n/**\\n * @param {number} a\\n * @param {number} b\\n */\\nfunction add(a, b) {\\n\\treturn a + b;\\n}\\n\\nlet a = 1;\\nlet b = 2;\\nlet total = add(a, b);\\nconsole.log(total); // 3\\n\\na = 3;\\nb = 4;\\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\\n```\\n\\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\\n\\n```js\\n/// file: index.js\\n// @filename: index.js\\n// ---cut---\\n/**\\n * @param {() => number} getA\\n * @param {() => number} getB\\n */\\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\\n\\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\\n}\\n\\nlet a = 1;\\nlet b = 2;\\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\\n\\na = 3;\\nb = 4;\\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\\n```\\n\\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\\n\\n```js\\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\\n```\\n\\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\\n\\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\\n\\n```js\\n/// file: index.js\\n// @filename: index.js\\n// ---cut---\\n/**\\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\\n */\\nfunction add(input) {\\n\\treturn {\\n\\t\\tget value() {\\n\\t\\t\\treturn input.a + input.b;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t};\\n}\\n\\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\\nlet total = add(input);\\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\\n\\ninput.a = 3;\\ninput.b = 4;\\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\\n```\\n\\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\\n\\n## Passing state across modules\\n\\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\\n\\n```js\\n/// file: state.svelte.js\\nexport let count = $state(0);\\n\\nexport function increment() {\\n\\tcount += 1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\\n\\n```js\\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\\n// @filename: index.ts\\ninterface Signal<T> {\\n\\tvalue: T;\\n}\\n\\ninterface Svelte {\\n\\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\\n\\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\\n\\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\\n}\\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\\n// ---cut---\\nexport let count = $.state(0);\\n\\nexport function increment() {\\n\\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\\n\\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\\n\\n```js\\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\\nexport let count = 0;\\n\\n// @filename: index.js\\n// ---cut---\\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\\n\\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\\n```\\n\\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\\n\\n```js\\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\\nexport const counter = $state({\\n\\tcount: 0\\n});\\n\\nexport function increment() {\\n\\tcounter.count += 1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n...or don't directly export it:\\n\\n```js\\nlet count = $state(0);\\n\\nexport function getCount() {\\n\\treturn count;\\n}\\n\\nexport function increment() {\\n\\tcount += 1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## basic-markup\\n\\nError: Section not found.\"}],\"isError\":false}"

[Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## basic-markup\n\nError: Section not found."

                  "content": "{\"content\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"## $state\\n\\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script>\\n\\tlet count = $state(0);\\n</script>\\n\\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\\n\\tclicks: {count}\\n</button>\\n```\\n\\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\\n\\n### Deep state\\n\\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\\n\\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\\n\\n```js\\nlet todos = $state([\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tdone: false,\\n\\t\\ttext: 'add more todos'\\n\\t}\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\\n\\n```js\\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\\n// ---cut---\\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\\n```\\n\\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\\n\\n```js\\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\\n// ---cut---\\ntodos.push({\\n\\tdone: false,\\n\\ttext: 'eat lunch'\\n});\\n```\\n\\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\\n\\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\\n\\n```js\\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\\n// ---cut---\\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\\n\\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\\n```\\n\\n### Classes\\n\\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\\n\\n```js\\n// @errors: 7006 2554\\nclass Todo {\\n\\tdone = $state(false);\\n\\n\\tconstructor(text) {\\n\\t\\tthis.text = $state(text);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\treset() {\\n\\t\\tthis.text = '';\\n\\t\\tthis.done = false;\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\\n\\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\\n\\treset\\n</button>\\n```\\n\\nYou can either use an inline function...\\n\\n```svelte\\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\\n\\treset\\n</button>\\n```\\n\\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\\n\\n```js\\n// @errors: 7006 2554\\nclass Todo {\\n\\tdone = $state(false);\\n\\n\\tconstructor(text) {\\n\\t\\tthis.text = $state(text);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\t+++reset = () => {+++\\n\\t\\tthis.text = '';\\n\\t\\tthis.done = false;\\n\\t}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Built-in classes\\n\\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\\n\\n## `$state.raw`\\n\\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\\n\\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\\n\\n```js\\nlet person = $state.raw({\\n\\tname: 'Heraclitus',\\n\\tage: 49\\n});\\n\\n// this will have no effect\\nperson.age += 1;\\n\\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\\nperson = {\\n\\tname: 'Heraclitus',\\n\\tage: 50\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\\n\\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\\n\\n## `$state.snapshot`\\n\\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<script>\\n\\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\\n\\n\\tfunction onclick() {\\n\\t\\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\\n\\t\\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\\n\\t}\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\\n\\n## `$state.eager`\\n\\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\\n\\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\\n\\n```svelte\\n<nav>\\n\\t<a href=\\\"/\\\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\\n\\t<a href=\\\"/about\\\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\\n</nav>\\n```\\n\\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\\n\\n## Passing state into functions\\n\\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\\n\\n```js\\n/// file: index.js\\n// @filename: index.js\\n// ---cut---\\n/**\\n * @param {number} a\\n * @param {number} b\\n */\\nfunction add(a, b) {\\n\\treturn a + b;\\n}\\n\\nlet a = 1;\\nlet b = 2;\\nlet total = add(a, b);\\nconsole.log(total); // 3\\n\\na = 3;\\nb = 4;\\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\\n```\\n\\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\\n\\n```js\\n/// file: index.js\\n// @filename: index.js\\n// ---cut---\\n/**\\n * @param {() => number} getA\\n * @param {() => number} getB\\n */\\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\\n\\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\\n}\\n\\nlet a = 1;\\nlet b = 2;\\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\\n\\na = 3;\\nb = 4;\\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\\n```\\n\\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\\n\\n```js\\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\\n```\\n\\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\\n\\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\\n\\n```js\\n/// file: index.js\\n// @filename: index.js\\n// ---cut---\\n/**\\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\\n */\\nfunction add(input) {\\n\\treturn {\\n\\t\\tget value() {\\n\\t\\t\\treturn input.a + input.b;\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t};\\n}\\n\\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\\nlet total = add(input);\\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\\n\\ninput.a = 3;\\ninput.b = 4;\\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\\n```\\n\\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\\n\\n## Passing state across modules\\n\\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\\n\\n```js\\n/// file: state.svelte.js\\nexport let count = $state(0);\\n\\nexport function increment() {\\n\\tcount += 1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\\n\\n```js\\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\\n// @filename: index.ts\\ninterface Signal<T> {\\n\\tvalue: T;\\n}\\n\\ninterface Svelte {\\n\\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\\n\\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\\n\\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\\n}\\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\\n// ---cut---\\nexport let count = $.state(0);\\n\\nexport function increment() {\\n\\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\\n\\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\\n\\n```js\\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\\nexport let count = 0;\\n\\n// @filename: index.js\\n// ---cut---\\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\\n\\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\\n```\\n\\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\\n\\n```js\\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\\nexport const counter = $state({\\n\\tcount: 0\\n});\\n\\nexport function increment() {\\n\\tcounter.count += 1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n...or don't directly export it:\\n\\n```js\\nlet count = $state(0);\\n\\nexport function getCount() {\\n\\treturn count;\\n}\\n\\nexport function increment() {\\n\\tcount += 1;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## basic-markup\\n\\nError: Section not found.\"}],\"isError\":false}"

                        "text": "## $state\n\nThe `$state` rune allows you to create _reactive state_, which means that your UI _reacts_ when it changes.\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet count = $state(0);\n</script>\n\n<button onclick={() => count++}>\n\tclicks: {count}\n</button>\n```\n\nUnlike other frameworks you may have encountered, there is no API for interacting with state — `count` is just a number, rather than an object or a function, and you can update it like you would update any other variable.\n\n### Deep state\n\nIf `$state` is used with an array or a simple object, the result is a deeply reactive _state proxy_. [Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow Svelte to run code when you read or write properties, including via methods like `array.push(...)`, triggering granular updates.\n\nState is proxified recursively until Svelte finds something other than an array or simple object (like a class or an object created with `Object.create`). In a case like this...\n\n```js\nlet todos = $state([\n\t{\n\t\tdone: false,\n\t\ttext: 'add more todos'\n\t}\n]);\n```\n\n...modifying an individual todo's property will trigger updates to anything in your UI that depends on that specific property:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\nIf you push a new object to the array, it will also be proxified:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\ntodos.push({\n\tdone: false,\n\ttext: 'eat lunch'\n});\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] When you update properties of proxies, the original object is _not_ mutated. If you need to use your own proxy handlers in a state proxy, [you should wrap the object _after_ wrapping it in `$state`](https://svelte.dev/playground/hello-world?version=latest#H4sIAAAAAAAACpWR3WoDIRCFX2UqhWyIJL3erAulL9C7XnQLMe5ksbUqOpsfln33YuyGFNJC8UKdc2bOhw7Myk9kJXsJ0nttO9jcR5KEG9AWJDwHdzwxznbaYGTl68Do5JM_FRifuh-9X8Y9Gkq1rYx4q66cJbQUWcmqqIL2VDe2IYMEbvuOikBADi-GJDSkXG-phId0G-frye2DO2psQYDFQ0Ys8gQO350dUkEydEg82T0GOs0nsSG9g2IqgxACZueo2ZUlpdvoDC6N64qsg1QKY8T2bpZp8gpIfbCQ85Zn50Ud82HkeY83uDjspenxv3jXcSDyjPWf9L1vJf0GH666J-jLu1ery4dV257IWXBWGa0-xFDMQdTTn2ScxWKsn86ROsLwQxqrVR5QM84Ij8TKFD2-cUZSm4O2LSt30kQcvwCgCmfZnAIAAA==).\n\nNote that if you destructure a reactive value, the references are not reactive — as in normal JavaScript, they are evaluated at the point of destructuring:\n\n```js\nlet todos = [{ done: false, text: 'add more todos' }];\n// ---cut---\nlet { done, text } = todos[0];\n\n// this will not affect the value of `done`\ntodos[0].done = !todos[0].done;\n```\n\n### Classes\n\nClass instances are not proxied. Instead, you can use `$state` in class fields (whether public or private), or as the first assignment to a property immediately inside the `constructor`:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\treset() {\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] The compiler transforms `done` and `text` into `get`/`set` methods on the class prototype referencing private fields. This means the properties are not enumerable.\n\nWhen calling methods in JavaScript, the value of [`this`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) matters. This won't work, because `this` inside the `reset` method will be the `<button>` rather than the `Todo`:\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick={todo.reset}>\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\nYou can either use an inline function...\n\n```svelte\n<button onclick=+++{() => todo.reset()}>+++\n\treset\n</button>\n```\n\n...or use an arrow function in the class definition:\n\n```js\n// @errors: 7006 2554\nclass Todo {\n\tdone = $state(false);\n\n\tconstructor(text) {\n\t\tthis.text = $state(text);\n\t}\n\n\t+++reset = () => {+++\n\t\tthis.text = '';\n\t\tthis.done = false;\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Built-in classes\n\nSvelte provides reactive implementations of built-in classes like `Set`, `Map`, `Date` and `URL` that can be imported from [`svelte/reactivity`](svelte-reactivity).\n\n## `$state.raw`\n\nIn cases where you don't want objects and arrays to be deeply reactive you can use `$state.raw`.\n\nState declared with `$state.raw` cannot be mutated; it can only be _reassigned_. In other words, rather than assigning to a property of an object, or using an array method like `push`, replace the object or array altogether if you'd like to update it:\n\n```js\nlet person = $state.raw({\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 49\n});\n\n// this will have no effect\nperson.age += 1;\n\n// this will work, because we're creating a new person\nperson = {\n\tname: 'Heraclitus',\n\tage: 50\n};\n```\n\nThis can improve performance with large arrays and objects that you weren't planning to mutate anyway, since it avoids the cost of making them reactive. Note that raw state can _contain_ reactive state (for example, a raw array of reactive objects).\n\nAs with `$state`, you can declare class fields using `$state.raw`.\n\n## `$state.snapshot`\n\nTo take a static snapshot of a deeply reactive `$state` proxy, use `$state.snapshot`:\n\n```svelte\n<script>\n\tlet counter = $state({ count: 0 });\n\n\tfunction onclick() {\n\t\t// Will log `{ count: ... }` rather than `Proxy { ... }`\n\t\tconsole.log($state.snapshot(counter));\n\t}\n</script>\n```\n\nThis is handy when you want to pass some state to an external library or API that doesn't expect a proxy, such as `structuredClone`.\n\n## `$state.eager`\n\nWhen state changes, it may not be reflected in the UI immediately if it is used by an `await` expression, because [updates are synchronized](await-expressions#Synchronized-updates).\n\nIn some cases, you may want to update the UI as soon as the state changes. For example, you might want to update a navigation bar when the user clicks on a link, so that they get visual feedback while waiting for the new page to load. To do this, use `$state.eager(value)`:\n\n```svelte\n<nav>\n\t<a href=\"/\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/' ? 'page' : null}>home</a>\n\t<a href=\"/about\" aria-current={$state.eager(pathname) === '/about' ? 'page' : null}>about</a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nUse this feature sparingly, and only to provide feedback in response to user action — in general, allowing Svelte to coordinate updates will provide a better user experience.\n\n## Passing state into functions\n\nJavaScript is a _pass-by-value_ language — when you call a function, the arguments are the _values_ rather than the _variables_. In other words:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {number} a\n * @param {number} b\n */\nfunction add(a, b) {\n\treturn a + b;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add(a, b);\nconsole.log(total); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(total); // still 3!\n```\n\nIf `add` wanted to have access to the _current_ values of `a` and `b`, and to return the current `total` value, you would need to use functions instead:\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {() => number} getA\n * @param {() => number} getB\n */\nfunction add(+++getA, getB+++) {\n\treturn +++() => getA() + getB()+++;\n}\n\nlet a = 1;\nlet b = 2;\nlet total = add+++(() => a, () => b)+++;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 3\n\na = 3;\nb = 4;\nconsole.log(+++total()+++); // 7\n```\n\nState in Svelte is no different — when you reference something declared with the `$state` rune...\n\n```js\nlet a = +++$state(1)+++;\nlet b = +++$state(2)+++;\n```\n\n...you're accessing its _current value_.\n\nNote that 'functions' is broad — it encompasses properties of proxies and [`get`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get)/[`set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) properties...\n\n```js\n/// file: index.js\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\n/**\n * @param {{ a: number, b: number }} input\n */\nfunction add(input) {\n\treturn {\n\t\tget value() {\n\t\t\treturn input.a + input.b;\n\t\t}\n\t};\n}\n\nlet input = $state({ a: 1, b: 2 });\nlet total = add(input);\nconsole.log(total.value); // 3\n\ninput.a = 3;\ninput.b = 4;\nconsole.log(total.value); // 7\n```\n\n...though if you find yourself writing code like that, consider using [classes](#Classes) instead.\n\n## Passing state across modules\n\nYou can declare state in `.svelte.js` and `.svelte.ts` files, but you can only _export_ that state if it's not directly reassigned. In other words you can't do this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = $state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\nThat's because every reference to `count` is transformed by the Svelte compiler — the code above is roughly equivalent to this:\n\n```js\n/// file: state.svelte.js (compiler output)\n// @filename: index.ts\ninterface Signal<T> {\n\tvalue: T;\n}\n\ninterface Svelte {\n\tstate<T>(value?: T): Signal<T>;\n\tget<T>(source: Signal<T>): T;\n\tset<T>(source: Signal<T>, value: T): void;\n}\ndeclare const $: Svelte;\n// ---cut---\nexport let count = $.state(0);\n\nexport function increment() {\n\t$.set(count, $.get(count) + 1);\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE] You can see the code Svelte generates by clicking the 'JS Output' tab in the [playground](/playground).\n\nSince the compiler only operates on one file at a time, if another file imports `count` Svelte doesn't know that it needs to wrap each reference in `$.get` and `$.set`:\n\n```js\n// @filename: state.svelte.js\nexport let count = 0;\n\n// @filename: index.js\n// ---cut---\nimport { count } from './state.svelte.js';\n\nconsole.log(typeof count); // 'object', not 'number'\n```\n\nThis leaves you with two options for sharing state between modules — either don't reassign it...\n\n```js\n// This is allowed — since we're updating\n// `counter.count` rather than `counter`,\n// Svelte doesn't wrap it in `$.state`\nexport const counter = $state({\n\tcount: 0\n});\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcounter.count += 1;\n}\n```\n\n...or don't directly export it:\n\n```js\nlet count = $state(0);\n\nexport function getCount() {\n\treturn count;\n}\n\nexport function increment() {\n\tcount += 1;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## basic-markup\n\nError: Section not found."
