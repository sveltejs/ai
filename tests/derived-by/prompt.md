# Text Analyzer Component Task

Create a Svelte 5 component that demonstrates the `$derived.by` rune for complex derivations.

The component should have a text input field and use `$derived.by` to calculate word count, character count, and whether the text is considered "long" (more than 15 words). Include a clear button to reset the text.
