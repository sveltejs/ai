# Card Component Task

Create a Svelte 5 Card component that uses the children snippet pattern.

The component should render any content passed to it inside a styled card wrapper. Use `$props` to destructure the `children` snippet and render it with `{@render children()}`. Optionally accept a `header` snippet prop that renders above the main content when provided.
