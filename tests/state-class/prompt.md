# Reactive Class Counter Task

Create a Svelte 5 component that uses a reactive class for state management.

Define a Counter class with:
- A `count` field using `$state` initialized to 0
- An `increment()` method that increases count by 1
- A `decrement()` method that decreases count by 1
- A `reset()` method that sets count back to 0

Instantiate the class and use it to build a counter UI with buttons for each action.
